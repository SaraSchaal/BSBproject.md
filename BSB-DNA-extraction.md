Sample selection **criteria**: total lenght of fish < than 30cm (except those from ME).

| Location | Number of individuals | Notes |
|----------|:-----------------------:|-------|
|Maryland, MD| 20 | 20 selected out of 28, pick smallest; all < 30cm |
|Maine, ME| 5 | all 5 samples available in Feb 2020; 2 < 30cm, 3 > 30cm |
|North Carolina, NC | 15 | all 15 samples available; all < 30cm |
|New Jersey, NJ | 20 | 20 selected out of 30, pick smallest; all < 30cm |
|Southern New England, SN | 4 | selected 4 out of 7 pick smallest; all < 30cm |
| **Total** | **64** | *Goal = 64 samples; multiples of 8 are easier to work with*|

------------------------------------------
### Procedure

#### Digestion - step 1, day 1 (the following corresponds to setps 1-4, page 8-9 in the kit manual (P), or quick guide (T))

1. Prep plate or tubes:

    * Lysis plates (P): pour TL buffer in a sterile weigh boat and use multi-channel to load plate wells. Tips should not touch side of wells, if they do, replace tips.

    * Spin tubes (T): pipette TL buffer directly into each 1.5 mL autoclaved eppendorf tube.

**Q FOR SARA: ADD PROTEASE TO THE BUFFER AT THIS POINT OR AFTER SAMPLES ARE IN?**
**ANWSER FROM SARA: After samples are put in**

2. Take 4-8 samples out of the freezer at the time; keep them on ice or cold beads.

    * Wipe bench with EtOH and gloved hands (between samples).

    * Flame tweezers (between samples) and blade (use one per sample).

    * Set weigh paper (use one per sample) onto scale and tare.

    * Take out a fin clip from first sample tube and place on a fresh kimwipe and squeeze with tweezers and blade to dry it out/get rid of liquid, to get accurate weight.

    * Cut a piece of the fin and weigh it – aim for 15 to 20 mg. Save the leftover sample, put back in sample tube.

3.  Remove the weigh paper with fin from balance and cut up fin in smaller pieces. Place cut up sample into corresponding plate well or spin tube using tweezers (if a piece falls out or touches any other surface, discard).

    * Repeat steps 2-3 until all samples are in buffer.

*Note: make sure samples are completely submersed in buffer - if not, add more buffer + protease and adjust volume of buffer in the following steps accordingly, as indicated.*

4. Place plate (cover with silicone mat) or tubes in thermomixer overnight at 60oC and SPEED? **Q FOR SARA - WHAT SPEED?**


#### Purification - step 2, day 2 (the following corresponds to steps 5-25 in the kit manual, page 9-11, with few modifications for plates (P) and the E.Z.N.A Tissue DNA kit quick guide for tubes (T)).

> *Buffer order: BL, HBC and DNA wash buffer - all stored at room temperature; elution buffer is not used, we elute in miliQ water at 60 – 70oC (ASK KATIE)*

> *Dilute **BL** buffer with 100% **ethanol** before use; volume of EtOH to add varies depending on which kit you have (kit ID D1196-00, add 25mL; D1196-01, add 100mL; D1196-02, add 500mL) - this is done once, mark cap of bottle once you've done it.*

> *Dilute **HBC** buffer with 100% **isopropanol** before use; volume of isopropanol to add varies depending on which kit you have (kit ID D1196-00, add 16mL; D1196-01, add 78mL; D1196-02, add 109mL per bottle) - this is done once, mark cap of bottle once you've done it.*

> *Dilute **DNA wash buffer** buffer with 100% **ethanol** before use; volume of isopropanol to add varies depending on which kit you have (kit ID D1196-00, add 100mL; D1196-01, add 400mL; D1196-02, add 800mL per bottle) - this is done once, mark cap of bottle once you've done it.*

   ##### **USING PLATES** *hint: if using the 300 uL multichannel pipette, do not load more than 250 uL (it gets too close to the top of the pipettor and could contaminate)*

5. (P) Shake or vortex the plate vigorously (holding the silicone cover mat) and ensure the lysate is completely homogeneous after shaking (if not further digestion is required). 

**Q FOR SARA: DID YOU DO THE OPTIONAL STEP "ADD RNASE"?**
**ANSWER FROM SARA: NO**

6. (P) Add two volumes (~450 uL) of BL buffer to each sample, then vortex samples for 1 min. 

**Q FOR SARA - IS BL BUFFER ADDED ON TOP OF THE TL BUFFER? OR AM I MISSING A STEP HERE? IN THE 'TUBES' PROTOCOL, THE SAMPLE IS CENTRIFUGED FIRST AND SUPERNATANT IS ISOLATED, AND THEN WE ADD BL BUFFER**
**ANWER FROM SARA: Yes its added ontop of it**

7. (P) Spin down for 4 min at top speed (because we have large pieces of tissue that won’t settle if just briefly spun, as described in the kit manual; also don’t want to spin too long because DNA will settle too and could be lost).

**Q FOR SARA - DID YOU DO THE OPTIONAL COLUMN EQUILIBRATION PROTOCOL (ADDING 3M NAOH)**
**ANSWER FROM SARA: NO**

8. (P) Place E-Z 96 DNA plate (mini-columns plate) on top of a 96-well square-well plate - tape them together.

9. (P) Pipette supernatant carefully out of lysis plate wells and into the mini-columns plate (discard the pellet) – large pieces of poorly digested tissue are likely to clog the tips and make it difficult to transfer.

**Q FOR SARA - IN THE PROTOCOL FOR SPIN TUBES, THE BL BUFFER IS ADDED AFTER THE SUPERNATANT IS ISOLATED? IN THE PLATE PROTOCOL, THE BL BUFFER IS ADDED BEFORE THE SUPERNATANT IS ISOLATED. DO YOU THINK THAT MATTERS?**

10. (P) Seal the E-Z 96 DENA Plate with aeraSeal film.

11. (P) Centrifuge at 4,000xg for 10 min. Then confirm that each sample has passed through the membrane in each well of the E-Z 96 DNA plate and into the square-well plate.

12. (P) Remove and discard the aeraseal film.

13. (P) Add 500 ul of HBC buffer (previously diluted) into to each mini-column and seal the plate with new aeraseal film.

14. (P) Centriguge 4,000xg for 5 min. then discard filtrate and reause the square-well plate.

15. (P) Remove and discard aeraseal film

16. (P) Add 600ul DNA wash buffer (diluted) to each well, seal the plate with new aeraseal film.

17. (P) Centrifuge 4000xg for 5 min, discard filtrate and re-tape/reuse the square-well plate.

18. (P) Repeat steps 15-17 for a second DNA wash step.

19. (P) Centrifuge the empty plate at 4000 g for 15 min. Discard the filtrate and the square-well plate.

**Q FOR SARA - THE MANUAL MENTIONS AN OPTION STEP TO DRY SAMPLES AT 70oC - DID YOU DO THAT? IF SO, FOR HOW LONG?**

20. (P) Transfer the mini-column plate to a set of 96-well racked microtubes (from kit).

21. (P) Remove and discard the aeraseal film.

22. (P) Add 200uL Elution buffer (or water, ask katie)

 **Q FOR SARA - SHOULD I USE MQ WATER? IF SO, AUTOCLAVED?**
 **ANSWER FROM SARA: MOLECULAR GRADE H20**
 
23. (P) Let it sit for 2-5 minutes.

24. (P) Centrifuge at 4000g for 5 min.

optional to repeate stps 21-24 for a second elution step - increases DNA yield but decreases DNA concentration. If higher concentration is desired, the second elutin can be done with 200uL eluate from first elution, reheated to 70oC

**Q TO SARA - DID YOU DO THE ABOVE OPTIONAL STEP?**
**ANSEWR FROM SARA: Yes but I elute into the same tube as the first elution**

25. (P) Seal the 96-racked microtubes with their caps and store at -20oC.

##### **USING TUBES**:

5. (T) Take tubes out of thermomixer, centrifuge at >10,000 for 5 min. 

6. (T) Transfer the supernatant to a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Do not disturbe or transfer any of the insoluble pellet.

**Q to SARA - DISCARD or SAVE PELLET?**
**ANSWER FROM SARA: I DISCARD**

7. (T) Add 220 uL BL buffer (adjust volume based on amount of starting material, if needed). Vortex to mix (a wispy precipitate may form upon addition of BL, ignore it).

8. (T) Incubate at 70oC for 10 min.

9. (T) Add 220 uL 100% ethanol (adjust this volume based on amount of starting material if needed). Vortex to mix.

10. (T) Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column into a 2 mL Collection tube.

11. (T) Transfer the entire sample from setp 9 to the column including any precipitates that may have formed.

12. (T) Centrifuge at max speed for 1 min, then discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.

13. (T) Add 500uL HBC buffer (previously diluted).

14. (T) Centrifuge at max speed for 30 sec, discard filtrate and collection tubes. 

15. (T) Insert the used column into a new collection tube.

16. (T) Add 70 uL DNA wash buffer (previously diluted), centrifuge at max speed for 30 sec, discard the filtrate and reused the collection tube.

17. (T) Repeat steps 16 for a second DNA wash step.

18. (T) Centrifuge the empty column at max speed for 2 min to dry the column - this step is critical to remove trace ethanol that will interfer with downstream applications.

19. (T) Transfer the column into a new nuclease-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 

20. (T) Add 100-200uL Elution Buffer (or miliQ water?) heated to 70oC, let it sit for 2 min. Centrifuge at max speed for 1 min.

21. (T) Repeat step 20 for a second elution step.

22. (T) Store eluted DNA at -20oC.
